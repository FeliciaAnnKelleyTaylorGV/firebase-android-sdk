This behavior is triggered when\r\n`isShrinkResources` is enabled and when \"strict\" rule. is added to\r\nresource shrinkage. e.g.\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<resources xmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\"\r\n    tools:shrinkMode=\"strict\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nb/311837855 advises that if strict mode is used, the keep rule is needed\r\nfor getIdentifier constants.\r\n\r\nSimulated tests by publishing local copy of the `firebase-crashlytics`,\r\nand `firebase-crashlytics-ndk`. Then testing with sample app variant\r\nthat includes `isShrinkResources` enabled in `build.gradle`\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuildTypes {\r\n    release {\r\n            isShrinkResources = true\r\n            isMinifyEnabled = true\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",
